Website for the Humanitarian Project: “Free Sessions During the Holidays”
Purpose of the Website
The main purpose of this website is to serve as an online platform for the humanitarian initiative “Free Sessions During the Holidays.” This project brings together psychotherapists who voluntarily offer free therapy sessions between December 15th and January 15th, a time of year that can be emotionally challenging for many. The website will act as a centralized and accessible directory of participating therapists.
The platform is designed to meet the needs of two key groups:
Psychotherapists, who want to easily join the initiative and create a profile to offer their services.

Clients, who are seeking emotional support and want to quickly and easily find a suitable therapist to contact.

The website should be intuitive, warm, and human-centered, removing any unnecessary barriers between people in need and available support.

Core Functionalities

1. Therapist Profiles / Backend for Therapists
   The platform will include a secure backend system where therapists can:
   Register and log in (with email verification to ensure authenticity).

Create and edit a profile by filling out a user-friendly form with the following information:

Full name

Short professional biography

Languages spoken

Therapeutic approaches used

Target groups (e.g., adults, adolescents, couples, families, etc.)

Location (online only or city/country if relevant)

Link for scheduling sessions (e.g., Calendly or other scheduling tool)

The process should be simple and efficient to encourage participation. 2. Search and Filtering for Clients
The directory will be publicly accessible and designed with ease of use in mind. Key functionalities for clients include:
Search options by therapist name, therapy language, type of therapy, location (city/country), and session mode (online/in-person).

Filter options by:

Availability (e.g., open for scheduling)

Target client groups (e.g., adolescents, couples)

Clear display of therapist profiles, shown as cards or a well-organized list, each including a brief overview and a direct contact button (email or scheduling link).

3. Design & User Experience (UX)
   The design should convey a sense of safety, warmth, and human connection—inviting users to feel supported and welcomed.

The platform must be fully responsive and function seamlessly on mobile devices, since many users will access it from their phones.

The user journey, especially for clients, should be as simple and smooth as possible—no registrations, no long forms, just fast access to support.

4. Admin Panel
   To ensure the quality and safety of the platform, an admin panel will be available for the project organizers to:
   Review, approve, edit, or deactivate therapist profiles.

Export the therapist database for project tracking, follow-up, and reporting purposes.

Timeline and Scope
The first working version of the website should be ready no later than mid-October. This will allow us to begin promoting the initiative and onboarding therapists by mid-November.
The directory must be fully functional and publicly available before the start of the free sessions, which will take place from December 15th to January 15th.
The scope of this initial version includes all essential features listed above. Future iterations may include improvements based on user feedback, added languages, or integrations with mental health support tools.
